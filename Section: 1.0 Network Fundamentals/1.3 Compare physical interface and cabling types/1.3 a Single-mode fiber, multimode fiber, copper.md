# PHYSICAL LAYER
At the Physical Layer we have the physical cabling. Three type of networking media copper,fiber, and wireless.
Fiber, The signals are patterns of light. Wireless, the signals are patterns of microwave transmissions.
And copper, the signals are patterns of electrical pulses sent over a circuit (circle +ve, -ve).

## Copper
- EMI aka CrossTalk caused by magnetic field around wires. This cause causes overlapping aka crosstalk. To solve this, the wires are twisted such that EMI gets cancelled.
- Note, when talking about CrossTalk interference, we are referring to EMI produced internally from the pairs of wires.
  
- External interference coming from other devices/environment can also cause errors when sending data over the wires. To solve this, we use what is known as Shielded Twisted Pair Cable or STP.
- STP cables have a metalic covering around our pair of wires to shield it from outside interference.
- Note: STP cables are expensive and MUST be grounded.
  
- On the other hand, Unshielded Twisted Pair(UTP) cables does not have any metalic shielding from external interferences.

Note:
- 1 Pair = 1 Signal (+ve and -ve) to form a circuit.
- You will notice we have 4 pairs which 8 wires in a UTP cable.

Electrical signals create a magnetic field that can cause problems on other nearby wires.
This phenomenon is known as 'crosstalk' in the Ethernet world, and its effects must be reduced as much as possible to have error-free communications.
