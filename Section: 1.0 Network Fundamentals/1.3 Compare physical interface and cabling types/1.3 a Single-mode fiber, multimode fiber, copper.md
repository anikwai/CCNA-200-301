# PHYSICAL LAYER
At the Physical Layer we have the physical cabling. Three type of networking media copper,fiber, and wireless.
Fiber, The signals are patterns of light. Wireless, the signals are patterns of microwave transmissions.
And copper, the signals are patterns of electrical pulses sent over a circuit (circle +ve, -ve).

## Copper
- EMI aka CrossTalk caused by magnetic field around wires. This cause causes overlapping aka crosstalk. To solve this, the wires are twisted such that EMI gets cancelled.
- Note, when talking about CrossTalk interference, we are referring to EMI produced internally from the pairs of wires.
  
- External interference coming from other devices/environment can also cause errors when sending data over the wires. To solve this, we use what is known as Shielded Twisted Pair Cable or STP.
- STP cables have a metalic covering around our pair of wires to shield it from outside interference.
- Note: STP cables are expensive and MUST be grounded.
  
- On the other hand, Unshielded Twisted Pair(UTP) cables does not have any metalic shielding from external interferences.

Note:
- 1 Pair = 1 Signal (+ve and -ve) to form a circuit.
- You will notice we have 4 pairs which 8 wires in a UTP cable.

Electrical signals create a magnetic field that can cause problems on other nearby wires.
This phenomenon is known as 'crosstalk' in the Ethernet world, and its effects must be reduced as much as possible to have error-free communications.

## Type of Cable and Explanation
1. MDI-MDIX:
   Straight-through Cable: Used to connect devices with different types of interfaces (e.g., a computer (MDI) to a switch/router (MDI-X)). The wiring directly connects each pin on one end to the same pin on the other end, facilitating communication between MDI and MDI-X interfaces.
   
2. MDI-MDI (100Mbps):
    Crossover Cable: Necessary when connecting two similar devices (e.g., two computers or two switches), which both use MDI interfaces. This cable crosses over transmit and receive pairs, allowing the devices to communicate properly at 100Mbps by ensuring that the transmit pair of one device is connected to the receive pair of the other.
   
3. MDI-MDI (1Gbps):
   Straight-through Cable: For Gigabit (1Gbps) connections, thanks to Auto-MDIX technology present in most modern devices, a straight-through cable can be used even when connecting similar devices (MDI to MDI). Auto-MDIX automatically adjusts the connection to match the cable, eliminating the need for crossover cables.
   
4. Router-CSU/DSU (T1):
   T1 Crossover Cable: Specialized for connecting a router to a CSU/DSU for T1 lines. It differs from typical Ethernet cables in the pinout used to match T1 framing requirements. This cable is necessary for the proper transmission of T1 signals between the router and the CSU/DSU.
   
5. PC-Router (Console):
    Console Cable: Also known as a rollover cable when used with Cisco devices, it connects a PC's serial port (or USB port using an adapter) to a router's console port for direct command-line interface access. The cable is typically flat and has a light blue color, with an RJ-45 connector on the router end and a DB9 or USB connector on the PC end, depending on the adapter used.
