# What is PoE?
PoE stands for "Power over Ethernet." It's a technology that allows network cables to carry electrical power, 
along with data, to devices such as IP cameras, VoIP phones, wireless access points, and other peripherals. 
This is especially useful in situations where it's impractical or expensive to run separate power lines. 
By using PoE, both power and data can be transmitted over a single Ethernet cable, 
simplifying the installation and reducing the amount of wiring needed.
