# Explain the role and function of a router
A router is a networking device that connects two or more IP networks or subnetworks.

In summary,
```markdown
The role of a router is to connect multiple networks and to manage the flow of data between them.
It forwards data packets to their intended destinations based on the information contained in the packets' headers (Destination IP Address).
The main function of a router is to facilitate communication between different networks by forwarding data packets
and determining the most efficient path for the data to travel.

- Routers operate at Network Layer (L3) of the OSI and TCP/IP model
- It is called Packets
- Routing/Forwarding is based on layer 3 destination IP address of the header
- Multi-Layer Switch (L3 Switch) does both L2 switching and L3 routing
- Firewalls can also does routing of packets i.e role of a router
- Routers encapsulate the packet into a L2 frame before sending it down the stack
